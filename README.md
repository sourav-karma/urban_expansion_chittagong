# urban_expansion_chittagong

this project aims to measure landuse and landcover change in Chittagong Metropolitan Area within the five years (2016-2021). Specific objectives of the study include:
• To determine the land cover of each landcover class in 2016 & 2021 at Chittagong Metropolitan Area
• To measure the land-use change detection from 2016 to 2021 and area under each conversion class
• To generate ideas about how the city land-use has expanded from the city center to buffer areas

Methodology:

Around 150 (Region of Interest) ROIs were drawn for all landcover classes each year to train the Maximum likelihood classifier algorithm. Then the images were classified into five specific classes: Waterbody, Vegetation, Agricultural land, Built area and Bare soil. Then urban expansion was calculated by drawing 1km consecutive ring buffers from the city center and calculating the percentage of each landcover class


Results are described in the presentation and the report files
